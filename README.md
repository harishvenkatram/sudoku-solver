# Sudoku Solver

Algorithm for solving Sudoku Puzzles

> Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. (Source - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku))

This is a project which taken an input of the sudoku puzzles as an 81 characters long string containing the digits from 0 to 9, where 0 represents an unfilled cell of the Sudoku Board. The objective of the algorithm is to replace all the zeros with valid digits such that the entire Sudoku Puzzle is solved. For doing this in a conventional way, the processor will require to try all 9<sup>81</sup> possible combinations in a worst case scenario which is a huge number. So, to solve this problem in a comparatively less time, the **Backtracking Algorithm** is one of the best solutions to it.
